Welcome to my blog! I am a retired ICT researcher, developer and
manager. In 1990s I participated in early developments of the Czech
academic Internet (CESNET project), and started the campus network of
the University of South Bohemia and Biology Centre CAS in České
Budějovice.

Since 2006 I've been actively involved in
[NETCONF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/netconf/about),
[NETMOD](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/netmod/about) and
[DNSOP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dnsop/about) working groups of
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). I authored or co-authored
[8 RFC
standards](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/search?name=&sort=&rfcs=on&by=author&author=Lhotka).

An open-ended list of topics that I might possibly
write about includes home automation and energy management, electromobility,
photovoltaics, programming, personal productivity tools, data crunching,
technical and scientific publishing, music, golf, …
