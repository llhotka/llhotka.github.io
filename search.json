An open-ended list of topics that I possibly might write about includes home automation and energy management, photovoltaics, programming, personal productivity, data crunching, technical and scientific publishing, music, golf, …\nI decided to use Quarto as the underlying framework, primarily because I plan to use technical contents such as statistics, graphs, tables or computations quite frequently in my blog posts, and Quarto’s plain-text approach (enriched Markdown with embedded code chunks) fits my preferences almost perfectly. But it also has to be said that together with GitHub Pages Quarto makes preparation and publishing of a blog site very easy and enjoyable."

    "text": "My main motivation for starting this blog site in the first place was to document the transition of our household from traditional energy consumption patterns to a more clever energy management.\nI’ve had several motivations to do so:\n\ncreate kind of project documentation that might come handy later\nwriting about a technical solution may help identify weak or overly complex points of the solution itself – if I am not able to describe it in a comprehensible manner, then it has to be redone or at least refactored\nother people facing similar challenges may learn from our experience and avoid repeating our mistakes, and also provide feedback.\n\nIndeed, our home is kind of traditional two-storey family house (at least according to Czech standards) built in 2004, located near České Budějovice in the altitude of 406 m above the sea level. We live in it together with my wife.\nWe currently use natural gas for heating and preparing hot water, for cooking and everything else we use electricity. In each of our two bathrooms we have a towel radiator that is connected to a central heating system, but also has a separate electric heating element that can be switched on independently.\nIn 2019, our 15 years old gas-fired boiler broke down and had to be promptly replaced. At that time, with no energy crisis yet in sight, it looked like a no-brainer to buy a gas condensing boiler as a replacement, and that’s what we did.\n\nEnergy bills\nAnyway, our energy consumption in the last five years is shown in Table 1. The condensing boiler apparently caused about 10% decrease in natural gas use. Electricity consumption rose in 2020 and 2021, which clearly has to do with the covid pandemic, as we both were working mostly from home office.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Yearly energy consumption 2017–2021\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nElectricity [MWh]\nGas [MWh]\n\n\n\n\n2017\n2.497\n25.857\n\n\n2018\n2.365\n23.738\n\n\n2019\n2.371\n23.563\n\n\n2020\n2.636\n20.838\n\n\n2021\n2.914\n22.996\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn any case, with our current electricity consumption the investment in a photovoltaic power plant (that was going to happen in late 2022, see TODO) would take quite long to return, even with current high energy prices. Unless, of course, we change the ways how we use electricity.\n\n\nImmediate actions\nWe have made a few significant steps already in 2022, i.e. before the PV system was installed. This section contains only a brief overview, some of these steps certainly deserve a closer look in future blog posts.\nFirst of all, I bought a couple of smart plugs capable of measuring instantaneous power and energy output, with two aims:\n\nevaluate actual power consumption of home appliances\nenable remote control of selected appliances, especially heaters, with the prospect of including them in automation scenarios.\n\nRegarding automation, I must admit that I am not a big fan of so-called smart homes. I think we can still operate lights and make our cups of tea manually. On the other hand, with electricity flowing down from our roof it makes a lot of sense to plan a bit ahead and turn on appliances, in particular the greedy ones, at appropriate times in order to minimize consumption from the grid. This is where a limited amount of automation comes handy.\nIn June\n\n\nWhat next?"
