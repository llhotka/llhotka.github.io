## Introduction

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) is a leading
open-source platform for home automation. My first experiments with it
date back to 2022, and my evolution path since then might be, I guess,
quite typical. I started small but kept adding new smart devices,
automations and all that stuff. Before long I realized that my
configuration has become complex and unwieldy. I found it quite difficult to
work with definitions scattered across the front-end UI pages and/or YAML
files, despite all the great improvements to the user interface that have
been introduced recently.

I spent some time considering my requirements and came up with the following list:
1. Source code management, i.e. , applied to all
   YAML definitions, perhaps except trivial ones.
1. Related definitions across all categories, such as automations, scripts or
   template sensors, should be kept together.
1. It should be possible to document definitions well beyond what's reasonable
   to have as object descriptions.

As it turned out, with the toolset that I've been using for decades, especially
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) and
[Org](https://orgmode.org), it was possible to achieve the above requirements
pretty easily. I understand that my solution isn't for everybody but, after two years
of almost daily usage it has been
working
