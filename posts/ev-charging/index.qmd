Among all disinformations about electromobility, the myths related to
various aspects of EV assume a very prominent place. Some of them are
relatively easy to debunk.

# Power consumption and range

The crucial argument of EV haters is the absolute range that one make on
one charge. The ID. Buzz is a mini van, so its aerodynamics is far from
perfect, but still, in my experience, the range per se isn't a real issue.
This of course depends on our usual travelling mode, which is quite relaxed:
on a motorway, we are fine with a steady speed of about 115 km/h, and don't
mind stopping every 2 hours for thirty minutes or so.
