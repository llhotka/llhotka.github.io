  When it comes to electromobility, and EV charging in particular,
  it is not always easy to tell apart truth from biased statements
  or outright lies. This blog post summarizes my experiences and
  surprises related to charging at public AC stations that are
  becoming pretty common in European cities.

A newcomer to an unknown territory, be it a foreign country or a new
technology, is often confronted with a reality that is different from
what s/he read or heard in advance about the subject. I've had 
a similar experience regarding electromobility, and especially EV charging.
The usual arguments circulating in the public space, no matter whether
they come from supporters or haters, are often oversimplified or biased.
The real problems are often more subtle and depend on a particular context.

Most of the discussions revolve around such aspect like the driving range
(the distance an EV can travel on a single charge), route planning or
charging speed. All this has to do with long-distance journeys and
high-speed (DC) charging. After 17 months and some 25 thousand kilometers
of my own EV experience, though, I tend to think that this is not a big
problem even now, and improvements in the charging infrastructure along the
motorways together with better on-board software can make it a non-issue
before long.

In my view, the real challenges for electromobility are in the boring
day-to-day EV usage and public AC charging infrastucture in cities.
Not everyone will be able to charge at home or in a garage, so a dense
network of AC chargers is a must. I this blog post, I am going to discuss
what I've learned so far about this type of charging, including some
unexpected surprises, both good and bad.

# My kingdom for a free charger!

If one looks into a map of AC chargers in a residential part of a big city,
it may often seem that they are pretty ubiquitous.
However, this doesn't mean that one can readily find an available charger
at any time of the day, week or year. I learned this the hard way once after
arriving to the St. Gilles quarter of Brussels on a workday at around 7pm.
Google Maps showed as many as eight public charging points in the vicinity
of the place where we stayed. After finding first two of them occupied, I parked
the car elsewhere and make a tour of the remaining ones by feet, only to find
that none of them was available. Even more frustrating was the fact that
about half of them were occupied by non-EV cars â€“ but this probably has to be
expected in a location where parking space is extremely precious.
